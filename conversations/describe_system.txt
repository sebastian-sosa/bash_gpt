Here is what I found:

- The operating system is Linux, version 6.4.16.
- The storage for the root directory is 59G, with 2.4G used, and 54G available. The usage is 5%.
- However, I couldn't find the specific details about the MacBook and its memory. The commands for getting those details are not found in the current environment. This might be because you're inside a Docker container or another limited context where those commands are not available.
